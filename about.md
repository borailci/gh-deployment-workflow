# About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation, cloud infrastructure, and modern software delivery practices. I specialize in building robust, scalable systems that enable teams to deploy faster and more reliably.

## Experience

- **Cloud Platforms**: Extensive experience with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes for scalable application deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and CloudFormation for reproducible infrastructure
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for system visibility

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on various DevOps projects that demonstrate best practices in:

- Automated deployment workflows
- Log management and analysis
- Performance monitoring
- Infrastructure automation

## Get in Touch
